"""LangGraph State schema for the MLE Agent.

Defines the TypedDict passed between all graph nodes.
See spec_state.md §3 for the authoritative field definitions.

Messages are stored as Anthropic API dicts ({"role": ..., "content": ...}).
- `messages`: no reducer — nodes return the full replacement list.
  Router wipes by returning []. Action/ToolNode append by returning
  state["messages"] + [new_msg].
- `all_messages`: operator.add reducer — append-only accumulator.
  Router appends current messages before wiping.
